## Overview/Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry. Our team was charged with exploring what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. Moreover, to turn those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Recommendations:
- Movies should be produced with higher regards to the global market than the domestic market.
- While the production of some genres is greater than others; avoid deciding on a movie genre because it is produced the most.

## Questions for Future Study:
- How to target the global market (i.e. genre choice, production language, casting, etc.).
- After enough data has been recorded, investigate how COVID-19 affected the movie industry.
- Look at which movie genres have historically been the most popular and their rate of success.
